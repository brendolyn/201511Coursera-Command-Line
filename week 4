You are performing an RNA-seq experiment to determine genes that are differentially expressed at different stages
in the development of Arabidopsis thaliana shoot apical meristem. You collected samples at day 8 and day 16 (files 
“Day8.fastq” and “Day16.fastq”), extracted and sequenced the cellular mRNA, and are now set to perform the bioinformatics
analysis. The reference genome you will need for the analysis is “athal_chr.fa” and the reference gene annotations are in
“athal_genes.gtf”. Use default parameters unless otherwise specified. Sample command files that you can modify to create 
your own pipeline are provided in the file “commands.tar.gz”. All files are provided in the archive gencommand_proj4.tar.gz. 

NOTE: The genome and annotation data were obtained and modified from the Arabidopsis Information Resources (TAIR) Database, 
and the RNA-seq reads were extracted from GenBank’s Short Read Archive (SRA). 

Create a bowtie index of the genome using bowtie2-build, with the prefix ‘athal’.
Include a copy of the reference genome with the name “athal.fa” in the index directory. 


Apply to question 1-5. 

Align both RNA-seq data sets to the reference genome using tophat. Analyze the results to answer 
the following questions. If multiple answers are required for one question, separate the answers
with a space (e.g., 1000 2000). 
$ bowtie2-build athal_chr.fa athal
$tophat2 -p 4 -o Day8/ -G athal_genes.gtf --transcriptome-index=athal.tr athal Day8.fastq
$tophat2 -p 4 -o Day16/ -G athal_genes.gtf --transcriptome-index=athal.tr athal Day16.fastq

Assemble the aligned RNA-seq reads into genes and transcripts using cufflinks. Use the labels ‘Day8’ and ‘Day16’,
respectively, when creating identifiers. For this portion of the analysis, answer the following questions. Use the 
same format as above for answers consisting of multiple values or parts. 
$cufflinks -o cufflink_day8/ -L day8 -p8 /home/guest/Documents/Coursera_commandline/gencommand_proj4/Day8/accepted_hits.bam

to consider only the reference transcripts that overlap some input transfrag. For this step, using the *.tmap files answer the following,
for both sets. Use the same format as above for answers consisting of multiple parts.
