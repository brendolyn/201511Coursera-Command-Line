Question 4
How many alignments show the read’s mate mapped to the same chromosome?
echo 150045-4938 = 145107

Questions 6 - 10: 
Extract only the alignments in the range “Chr3:11,777,000-11,794,000”, corresponding to a locus of interest. For this alignment set: 
samtools view file.bam "Chr3:11777000-1179400" out_put_file

Question 6
How many alignments does the set contain?
answer = 7081

Question 7
How many alignments show the read’s mate unmapped?
answer =483
# use the field information of RNEXT or QNEXT
Question 8
How many alignments contain a deletion (D)?
answer = 31
# use the CIGAR infromation
# samtools view file_bam| more | cut -f6 | grep "N" | wc -l

Question 9
How many alignments show the read’s mate mapped to the same chromosome?
answer = 4670
# use filed information of RNEXT

Question 10
How many alignments are spliced?
anser = 0
# use the CIGAR information

Question 11
How many sequences are in the genome file?
answer = 5
# use the samtools -H file.bam to see the header information

Question 12
What is the length of the first sequence in the genome file?
answer = 29923332

Question 13
What alignment tool was used?
anser = stampy

Question 14
What is the read identifier (name) for the first alignment?
answer = WII-PERO1

Question 15
What is the start position of this read’s mate on the genome? Give this as ‘chrom:pos’ if the read was mapped, or ‘*” if unmapped.
answer = 11699950
Questions 16 - 20: 
Using BEDtools, examine how many of the alignments at point 2 overlap exons at the locus of interest. 
Use the BEDtools ‘-wo’ option to only report non-zero overlaps. The list of exons is given in the included 
‘athal_wu_0_A_annot.gtf’ GTF file. 

# bedtools intersect -wo -a athal_wu_0_A_annot.gtf -b athal_wu_0_A.bam | wc -l

Question 16
How many overlaps (each overlap is reported on one line) are reported?
anser = 3101

Question 17
How many of these are 10 bases or longer?
# bedtools intersect -wo -a athal_wu_0_A_annot.gtf -b athal_wu_0_A.bam |cut -f 14 | sort -n -r | grep -i -E '[1-9][1-9]' | wc -l
answer = 1442

Question 18
How many alignments overlap the annotations?


Question 19
Conversely, how many exons have reads mapped to them?
bedtools intersect -wo -a athal_wu_0_A_annot.gtf -b athal_wu_0_A.bam | cut -f4 | sort -u | wc -l
answer =1818

Question 20
If you were to convert the transcript annotations in the file “athal_wu_0_A_annot.gtf” into BED format, how many BED records would be generated?
answer = 4
cut -f 9 athal_wu_0_A.gtf | sort -u | wc -l
